		<p>Hi!</p>
		<p>This is the demo app for our session at <b>ConnectED 2015</b> in January in Orlando. It's build using AngularJS and uses a Domino backend.</p>
		<p>In the session we're going to talk about building web apps using the AngularJS JavaScript framework, combined with a Domino backend. We will show you how an app built like this can run in multiple runtimes, like Domino, Bluemix, Connections and Worklight.</p>
		<p>Hopefully we'll see you there. It'll be worth it!</p>

			<p>Here comes the fine print...</p>

				We did our best. Worked our ass off. But take absolutely no liability for the accurateness of the data in this app, or if the app will work at all. It probably will. We hope.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh, and if you want to know how this app was built: talk to use if you see us walking around. That's what a conference is all about (you seriously thought it was the sessions?). We are not scary and will talk for beer :-)
